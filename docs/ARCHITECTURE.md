```

The manager never talks to the game server over the network. Everything goes through small text files in `mods/<mod>/settings/`, which the server module `coopbots.py` reads and writes. No open admin port, no password.

| File | Written by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `coop_server.txt` | manager | bot values per size and map, humans per team, commander, adaptive difficulty, one-time values |
| `coop_cmd.txt` | manager | live commands with increasing IDs; only `sv.*`, `mapList.*`, `admin.*`, `game.say*`, `@nextmap`, `@commander` are executed |
| `coop_live.txt` | module | heartbeat, map, team sizes, human players, module version |
| `coop_status.txt` | module | log shown on the Live page |
| `coop_rounds.txt` | module | one block per finished round for the leaderboard |

`coopbots.py` must stay **Python 2.3 compatible** (BF2's embedded Python): no `sorted()`, no generator expressions, no `with`, no conditional expressions, no `except X as e`.

## Source layout

```
src/
  App/        MainForm (partial class, one file per page), Program, Config
  UI/         Theme, controls (cards, switches, lists, dialogs), widgets, command dialog
  Model/      settings table (bilingual), bot planning and coop_server.txt, leaderboard, command catalog
  Game/       game folder and versions, mods and profiles, .con files, map scanner, patches (unlock, 4 GB, DirectX)
  Server/     server process and live channel, coopbots.py (embedded)
  Services/   installer, admin tasks (UAC), firewall, PC check, updater, LAN service, diagnostics
tests/        console test runner
build/        icon, manifest, resource script, Linux build script
```

## Key design decisions

- **Single exe, no dependencies.** Personal data in `%APPDATA%\BF2Manager`; shared LAN extras in `<game>\_LAN`.
- **Portable mode.** If `BF2.exe` is next to the manager, that folder is the game folder.
- **Admin rights only when needed.** Tasks that need them (setup, patches in Program Files, firewall, DirectX, update swap) are collected into one job and run by a second instance of the exe via `runas` (`--task-job`). One Windows prompt for several fixes.
- **Bilingual.** Every UI string is `T("Deutsch", "English")`; the settings table has both languages per row.
- **Own scrolling.** `ScrollHost` replaces WinForms AutoScroll; the offset is clamped to the content height on every change.
- **Never trust `Control.Visible` as state.** It returns false while the page is hidden. Layout code decides visibility from its own state.

## Updater

1. `GET api.github.com/repos/AnselmJo/bf2-manager/releases` (TLS 1.2, 5 s timeout, silent without internet).
2. Newest non-draft release newer than `AppInfo.Version` (pre-releases optional) with assets `BF2Manager.exe` and `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
3. Download next to the exe as `.new`, verify SHA256, rename the running exe to `.old`, move the new file in place (elevated if the folder is not writable), start the new exe with `--updated <old version>` and exit. The new instance waits for the single-instance mutex, shows the release notes and deletes leftovers. *Previous version* swaps `.old` back.
4. After an update an outdated bot module is replaced silently if the mod folder is writable.

## LAN service

- **Beacon** (server PC): UDP broadcast to port 29960 every 3 s: `BF2SM1|name|gamePort|mod|map|humans|max|httpPort|version|mode|running`.
- **Listener** (every PC): collects beacons, entries expire after 12 s.
- **File service** (server PC, TCP 29961, minimal HTTP/1.0, read-only): `/info`, `/manifest?mod=`, `/file?mod=&p=`, `/manager`, `/manager.sha256`. Only files inside `mods/<mod>`; server-only folders (`settings`, `python`, `ai`) and logs are excluded; path traversal is rejected.
- **Manifest:** relative path, size, SHA1. Hashes are cached per file (size + modification time) in `%APPDATA%\BF2Manager\cache`.
- **Sync:** each file is downloaded to `.part`, verified, then replaces the local file. Extra local files are never deleted.
