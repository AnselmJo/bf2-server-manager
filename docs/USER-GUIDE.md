# User guide

Switch between **Play** and **Host** at the top left. Every setting has an **ⓘ** with an explanation, the default and when a change applies. Everything is saved automatically.

## Where the manager lives

The manager finds the game folder by itself when it sits **next to it** (`Battlefield2\BF2Manager.exe` and `Battlefield2\Battlefield 2\BF2.exe`), inside it, or in a subfolder such as `_LAN`.

Started from Downloads or a ZIP? The manager offers once to **copy itself next to the game folder**, adds the firewall rule for that place, puts a *BF2 Manager* shortcut on the desktop and restarts from there. The old copy can be deleted afterwards. Any time later: *Settings › Folders › Copy manager next to the game folder*.

## First start

A welcome window asks for two things: the **game folder** (found automatically; otherwise *Choose folder*) and your **player name**. The manager creates your Battlefield 2 profile if there is none. *Later* skips it – the **Your player** card on *Play* asks again. Run it again any time: *Profile › Run first-time setup again*.

## Play

**Your player** – your name, **Change name** (applies right away), profile switcher when you have several, and the *Profile* menu: **New profile**, **Repair profile** (fresh files, same name – helps when BF2 hangs at start or when joining), **Delete profile**, open the profile folder. Every change is backed up to `Documents\BF2_Backups`. While BF2 runs, the card offers **Game stuck? Close it** with tips.

**Play** – the main view. Running servers on the network appear automatically with map, size, mode, players, bots and mod. The list updates itself every few seconds; **Refresh** clears it and searches right away. A server running on this PC is always listed and marked *this PC*.
- **✓ Compatible** → click **Join**. The game starts in the server's mod, logs in and joins.
- **⚠ Mod missing / different version** → **Get files from server** compares your mod with the server PC and copies only what differs (each file is verified).
- **Manager x.y – update** appears when the server PC has a newer manager.
- No server? *Start game without server* opens the main menu. *Server not found?* lets you enter an IP (only needed for VPN LANs).
- When something on this PC needs attention, a yellow bar with **Fix** appears at the top; when all is well the card just shows *✓ This PC is ready*.

**Settings** – This PC (check and fixes, click to expand; *Server search on LAN* tests whether the firewall lets the manager's announcements through and offers *Allow in firewall*), Game start (windowed, skip intro, log in automatically), Graphics (incl. optional ReShade), Audio, Mods (versions), Updates, Diagnostics, Language, Folders (incl. *Change game folder*).

**ReShade (optional)** – image filters for a sharper, more vivid look. The manager does not ship ReShade; *Set up* explains how to install it from the official ReShade website (Direct3D 9, select BF2.exe). Afterwards a switch turns it on and off. If BF2 freezes, switch it off first.

## Host

On the first switch to *Host* you set up the server once (pick mods, one Windows prompt). The top bar shows mod, mode, server status, **Join** (your own server) and **Start/Stop server**.

**Server** – while the server is stopped: build the rotation.
- Double-click a map on the left (filter by size) to add it. Drag the **≡** handle to sort, **right-click** for more (custom bot values, duplicate, remove). The icons below the rotation: up, down, remove, shuffle, undo, clear (hover for a tooltip).
- Select a map to see its preview and its **bot values**. *Custom values* gives this map its own bots (★).
- **Recent & presets**: reload a configuration you started before, or save/load named presets.

**Console and results:** type a command under *Actions* (or pick one via *Commands*); the server answers within a few seconds and the answer appears below the field. `kick <name>` and `ban <name>` work with the player name. **Change bots …** sets the bot count for the running map (the map reloads, players stay connected) – kicking single bots does not help, the AI refills them.

**Keep vehicles off:** `sv.noVehicles` only works in *Conquest*. In *Coop* the game ignores it.

While the server runs, **Server** shows the **live view**: players (kick), current and upcoming maps, next map now, restart round, message to all, console with **Commands** assistant, scheduled messages, evening leaderboard. *Edit rotation & bots* switches to the configuration – changes apply from the next map and are sent to the server automatically.

**Bots** – default bot values per map size (16/32/64), humans per team, adaptive difficulty, **bot radio messages** on/off (applies at the next server start), bot names and the mod's AI file (*Advanced*).

**Options** – every server setting. Cards *Server behaviour* (automatic restart after a crash or hang, server unlocks, LAN service) and *Default* (use current values as your default for all mods, reset to default, factory settings). While the server runs: ⚡ values apply immediately, the bar shows how many changes need a restart and offers **Restart now**.

## When do changes apply?

| | |
|---|---|
| ⚡ immediately | message, kick, respawn time, friendly fire and other ⚡ settings |
| next map | rotation, bots, difficulty, custom map values |
| after a restart | mod, mode, max. players, port and other settings without ⚡ |

## Diagnostics

*Settings › Diagnostics*: detected problems, **Server log**, **Export diagnostics** (ZIP with versions, Windows version, mods, configuration, logs and problems – without passwords, user names and public IP addresses), **Repair**.
